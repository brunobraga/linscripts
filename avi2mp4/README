Installation:
-------------

    This is a simple script that requires no specific installation, besides the
    basic that comes in practically every linux distribution. 
    
    For production basis usage, it is advised to place this script in a 
    directory with proper permission control.
    
    Eg. /usr/local/scripts/logmon/
    
Usage:
------

    avi2mp4 [OPTIONS] [file1]...[dirN]

    Converts avi video files into mp4 format (iPod ready, 640x480).


    Arguments:
    ----------

      [file1]...[dirN]  the file(s) or directory(ies) to be converted into mp4
                        format. If it is a directory (can be multiple), 
                        all files in avi format will be converted.
    
    Options:  
    --------  

      -h, --help        prints this help information
      
      -o  --output      the output directory to save the converted files.
                        if not informed, [~/Desktop] will be used.
      -v, --verbose     displays the ffmpeg output 
                        (too dirty for multiple files)

    Dependencies:
    -------------
        
         ffmpeg (with proper x264 codec configured)


    Examples:
    ---------
        # converts file 1.avi into 1.mp4
        ./avi2mp4.sh /path/to/video/1.avi
        
        # converts all files wihin the directories A and B.
        ./avi2mp4.sh /path/to/videos/A/ /path/to/videos/B/

    Additional Info:
    ----------------
    
        (1) Be patient! Converting files may take long time depending on the 
            video size.
